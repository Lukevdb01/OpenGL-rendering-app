## OpenGL Rendering App

This project was originally developed in December 2022 as part of a school assignment. I had the freedom to choose my own subject, and since 3D rendering had always been on my learning list, I proposed the idea to my teacher—who encouraged me to pursue it.

Unfortunately, the original GitHub repository (on my old account) was accidentally deleted. Fortunately, I discovered a copy of the source code on one of my USB drives. This repository now serves as an archive, preserving the project in its last working state.

In the future—whether near or far—I may restart development. The project already contains the foundational building blocks for creating a game entirely from scratch, without relying on traditional engines like Unreal Engine or Unity.

#### Edit

As of today i restarted development on this project, with the goal of turning it in a small game engine with python as programming language.
The *orginal* project code can be found on the main branch -> https://github.com/Lukevdb01/OpenGL-rendering-app/tree/main
